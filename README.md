A simple HTTP web service to help run faster meetings

## TODO:

1. Build basic Go http server
2. Provide route handlers for various meeting related actions:
    a. Create a new meeting (maybe a meeting can have various types)
    b. Maintain db of meetings, allow browsing and download of the same 
    c. View of pending action items by user
    d. More stuff I am surely forgetting
3. Store these meetings as .md / .pdf files
